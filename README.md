# Tavatui Space

At the end of November, I went to a shift at the Tavatui Education Center to decipher noise signals from satellites. the tasks presented in this repository are part of the work done during the educational process

We were processing the pictures, getting rid of noise, so in the repository you can find examples of works written in Python
